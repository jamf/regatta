# User Guide

Throughout this documentation, we are using [gRPCurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl)
to interact with Regatta's gRPC API.

To follow this user guide, it is enough to spin up a single Regatta leader cluster
with one instance locally as described in [Quickstart](../quickstart).

See [API documentation](../api.md#regatta-proto) for the complete user-facing gRPC API reference.
